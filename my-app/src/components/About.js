      Our Mission SpaceX was founded in 2002 with the goal of revolutionizing
      space technology, making space exploration more accessible, and ultimately
      enabling humans to become a multi-planetary species. Our mission is to
      reduce the cost of space travel and enable the colonization of Mars.
      <p className="text-3xl font-bold m-10">Visionary Leadership</p> Led by CEO Elon Musk, SpaceX has become a
      global leader in aerospace innovation. With a bold vision and relentless
      pursuit of excellence, Elon Musk and his team have pushed the boundaries
      of what is possible in space exploration. ### <p className="text-3xl font-bold m-10">Cutting-Edge</p>{" "}
      Technology At SpaceX, we are committed to pushing the boundaries of
      technology. From the development of the Falcon rockets to the
      groundbreaking Dragon spacecraft, our engineers and scientists are
      dedicated to designing and building the most advanced space vehicles in
      the world. ### <p className="text-3xl font-bold m-10">Achievements</p> Since our founding, SpaceX has achieved
      numerous milestones in space exploration. We were the first private
      company to send a spacecraft to orbit and recover it, the first to dock a
      spacecraft with the International Space Station, and the first to land a
      reusable rocket. ### <p className="text-3xl font-bold m-10">Future Goals</p> Looking ahead, SpaceX is working
      towards even more ambitious goals. We are developing the Starship
      spacecraft, which will be capable of carrying humans to Mars and beyond.
      Our ultimate goal is to establish a sustainable human presence on Mars and
      explore other destinations in the solar system.
